# generateRandomNumbersCPP
I am learning C++, so I wrote this script to generate random numbers.

You can choose the minimum and maximum number from the range, as well as how many numbers you want to generate.

For example:
Enter the mimimum value from the range (of numbers): 1
Enter the maximum value from the range (of numbers): 49
How many numbers do you want to generate: 6
42 36 38 5 49 18
